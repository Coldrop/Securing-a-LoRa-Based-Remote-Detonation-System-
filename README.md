# Securing a LoRaWAN-Based Remote Detonation System

## Overview

This repository contains my academic research on **securing a LoRaWAN-based remote detonation system** used in **underground mining**.

The project focuses on:

- Identifying vulnerabilities
- Strengthening system safety against **misuse** and **unintended activation**

## Research Scope

- Study of **LoRaWAN communication architecture** in industrial detonation systems
- Structured threat identification using the **Delphi risk analysis method**
- Analysis of key risks including:
  - Insider misuse
  - Replay attacks
  - Unintended detonation
  - Eavesdropping and command injection

## Conclusion

This research:

- Evaluates potential **security weaknesses** in current implementations
- Proposes improvements to enhance:
  - Authentication
  - Communication integrity
  - Operational safety

in **high-risk industrial environments** such as underground mining.
